tModLoader Installer - by lando

This is a simple app for users that want a fast and easy way to install the tModLoader API.

This does not work on pirated/cracked copies of Terraria, and I don't have an intention of making them work.

This is the semi-GUI version of the installer. Requires that you have wget, unzip, and kdialog, app will check for those packages.
